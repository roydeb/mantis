Check g++, zlib and sdsl-lite installations as required by mantis

Install pistache from the following webpage:
http://pistache.io/quickstart#installing-pistache

Here is the process from the above site:
cd pistache
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
sudo make install

Type this command on terminal:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

Now go to mantis folder and build and make as usual. 

Run the server in the bin folder: ./bin/rserver

Make curl requests to the server:
Example curl requests:

curl -X POST http://localhost:9080/query/raw%2F/query.res/raw%2Finput_txns.fa/

curl -X POST http://localhost:9080/build-mst/raw%2F/1/0/

curl -X POST http://localhost:9080/build/20/raw%2Finput_txns.fa/raw%2F/
